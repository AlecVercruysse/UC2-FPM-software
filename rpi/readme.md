 - Please read the docstring for ~run_fpm.py~ to set up the pi.
 - check the configuration options in ~run_fpm.py~!!
 - ensure ~mosquitto~ and ~mosquitto_clients~ is installed (with apt).
   - monitor mqtt with: ~mosquitto_sub -t -v '#'~. (hashtag is a wildcard)
   - send test messages with (e.g.): ~mosquitto_pub -t '/FPMSCOPE/LEDMATRIX/RECM' -m 'PXL+0+255+0+0'~
   - see man pages for more.
 - clone this repo to home dir of the pi if possible, so the default script path on the server's ~run_fpm.py~ is correct.
